To play FEARLESS FLIGHT, download the entire "FearlessFlightCode" folder as a zip. Unzip (decompress) the folder and open the .html file called "index" in a browser. 
-------------------------------------HOW TO- PLAY-------------------------------------  
Press any key to exit the opening title and access the menu. From there, use the  mouse to pick any of the customizable options. A plane must be either red, blue, or  green. Easy mode is characterized by slower game play. The harder the mode, the  faster objects will move. Pressing B at any time will return you to this menu.   Once you customize your gameplay, press ENTER to begin the tutorial. The tutorial can  be skipped by pressing ENTER again. You can read through the entire tutorial, or  switch between the tutorial screens, by pressing the right and left arrow keys.  During the tutorial, you may test out your plane's capabilities, which include moving up and down using the mouse location, and firing bullets using the SPACEBAR.  Once you leave the tutorial screen, gameplay begins, and enemies will begin to spawn.  Use the SPACEBAR to shoot enemies. Shooting a bird will deduct points from your  score. Shooting a plane will add points to your score. Being hit by either will kill your plane and cause the game to end. If you lose, your score is still saved in the high score list if it is high enough to make the ranks.   The game runs on a timer, so if you play for long enough, you can win. If you win, your plane will reach the Island and the game will end. Your score will be added to  the high score list if it is high enough. From there, you can play again by pressing  any key. You will be redirected to the menu to customize your options again.
